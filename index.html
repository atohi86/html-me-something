           <h1>My Favorite Vacation</h1>
           <p><small>By Paul Stout</small></p>
           <p>My favorite vacation took place over several states out west in May of 2018. My wife and I got married in January but didn’t take this trip until mid-May. I started classes the Monday after our wedding and the first quarter of the year is extremely busy for her, so we decided to wait until we had some free time. Before the vacation, us and our family spent several days in Tulsa, OK. On the Saturday me and the wife picked up our rental car and headed west. A funny tidbit about the rental car was that the agent thought me and my wife was brother and sister.</p>

               <h2>Day 1</h2>
               <p>Our stopping point on day one was Albuquerque, NM. On our way out we stopped in Arcadia, OK at Pop’s Soda Shop. They have thousands of different types of soda and we stocked up on a few after we had lunch. They also have this really unique sculpture out front.</p>

               <p>As we continued out west through Oklahoma, Texas and into New Mexico I was so fascinated with the landscape. I am used to wooded hills and valleys and even though New Mexico has the hills and valleys they also have this vast open. As we drove, we spotted a storm off in the distance and it took us a couple hours to finally reach it. </p>

                       I pulled over to get this picture of the eventual storm. I was really amazed by how far you could see in New Mexico.

                <h2>Day 2</h2>
                <p>As were leaving Albuquerque the next morning we topped the hill heading outside of town and we decided that we needed some gas and no so healthy breakfast from a Love’s truck stop. As we are pulling out, we notice a makeshift lookout point down to the left and decide to head that way. I took a picture of Albuquerque as we stood there and admired how beautiful the city was in the morning glow.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Later in the day we stopped in Grants, NM to fill up on gas, drinks, and snacks. When I take any type of trip that involves driving, I am more of a plan a route and stick to that plan type of person. My wife on the other hand is more of a head in a general direction and get lost in a wanderlust kind of way. She looks and notices that there is a nature area south of our location and suggest that we visit it. We do and we ended up at the Sandstone Bluff Overlook (pictured below). Once again, I was in awestruck of New Mexico’s beautiful landscape.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>After we left the overlook, we decided to turn away from the interstate and just drive. In a few minutes we came upon a trailhead and we decided to park and walk and see what we could find. The next picture is the La Vantana National Arch and I was very happy that I decided to be more spontaneous.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>After leaving the Arch, we just drove south. Every time we came to an intersection, we turned west and after a few hours we ended up back at the interstate and we headed west towards Flagstaff, AZ.</p>

                <h2>Day 3</h2>
                <p>We stayed in Flagstaff, which is a town I would love to visit more of. There are two ways to the Grand Canyon. One, you head west to Williams, AZ and then head north highway 64 to the canyon or you can head north on highway 180 north of Flagstaff which takes you around Humphreys Peak and I would highly suggest taking 180. It is absolutely beautiful, and I would also recommend staying in Flagstaff the night before. When we were looking for hotels, the ones in Williams were twice as more than Flagstaff and there is also a better selection in Flagstaff.</p>

            </section>
            <p>When going into the Grand Canyon you initially enter Tusayan, AZ and most of the Grand Canyon stuff is located here. If you want to take aerial tours, you do it here. Another recommendation I have is what we did. Instead of driving to the Grand Canyon entrance, we parked at the IMAX and went inside and purchased the passes to the Canyon and then went out front and caught a bus that takes you to the Grand Canyon Visitor Center. You bypass a lot of traffic and crowds and it is a lot faster and doesn’t cost anything extra. Once you get to the Visitor Center you then catch the corresponding bus that takes you where you want to go within the park.</p>
            <p>You always hear how the Grand Canyon will leave you speechless and how there are no words for it. I truly believe that you cannot ever prepare yourself for seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time. The bus drops you off at the bottom of this walkway and you go up to this landing and you see glimpses of it and then there it is. There is this opening, and you are standing in front of the Canyon. I was frozen, I stood there and gazed upon this massive canyon that looked like a painting. You feel very little once you see it.</p>

                <figcaption>No picture I could ever take would do the Canyon justice. I highly recommend visiting.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We left the Canyon around 4 P.M. and I wished I could have spent the remaining week there. Our plan was to make it to Las Vegas and stay two or three days and then try and make it to Monument Valley, UT. We spent the next few hours driving. It was dark when we made it to Las Vegas and as you are near the city you can see this glow from miles and miles. When you come out of Boulder City on Interstate 11 you top this ridge and BAM, laid before you is Las Vegas. There are so many lights and colors and you are taken back. I would have gotten a picture, but I couldn’t get pulled over in time.</p>

                <h2>Day 4 & 5</h2>
                <p>If I had to have a low point in this trip, I would say it was Las Vegas. I really enjoyed it but compared to everything else it was on the bottom of my list. I didn’t take any pictures while I was in Las Vegas which I regret. We stayed at the El Cortez Hotel & Cabanas which is near Fremont street. On our first day we visited the Fremont Street Experience and just walked around. Afterwards we went to the Mob Museum which was extremely interesting since I am a history buff. After the museum we walked around the strip which I didn’t enjoy much since there is tons of people. I had really wanted to go to Hoover Dam, but it was closed for repairs.</p>
                <p>After some reviewing of how much time we had left we decided that we couldn’t visit Monument Valley and Santa Fe and be back home by Sunday evening, so we decided to visit the North Rim of the Grand Canyon instead since the pass was good for both parks for maybe a week. We headed out of Las Vegas towards Kanab, UT. Kanab was the closet town to the North Rim offering lodging. The drive to Utah was great and beautiful and other than a quick meeting about speed with two Arizona State troopers we got to Knab fairly quickly. If you chose to stay in Kanab, be prepared to pay a lot of money for a motel room that doesn’t cost very much in NWA. Kanab is a very beautiful town, and I would of like to have spent more time in that area.</p>

                <h2>Day 6</h2>
                <p>We left Kanab about 4 in the morning. I hadn’t sleep at all the previous night due to the A/C not working. If I am hot then I don’t sleep at all and the wife woke up early due to the same problem and we decided to head to the North Rim. We drove for about an hour and a half and was just into the Kaibab National Forest when we counted our 42nd deer. We pulled over to get the following picture and decided to head back towards Albuquerque since we were both very tired and we were both very nervous about hitting a deer in our rental car. There wasn’t any cell service and we felt the potential trouble wasn’t worth it.</p>

                <p>Heading back towards Albuquerque we stumbled upon the Pasture Canyon Lookout, the Cliff Dweller Stone House area, and the Navajo Bridge overlooking the Colorado River.</p>

                <h2>Day 7</h2>
                <p>We had a wonderful night in Albuquerque and decided to head home. We drove all day and reached Tulsa in the evening to turn in our rental car. We got back home to NWA later that night and was glad to see family again and glad to be back in our bed.</p>
                <p>I’ve taken many vacations since then, domestically and internationally, but this will always be my favorite vacation. I learned so much about my wife and she learned a lot about me. I got to see the most beautiful landscapes and I got to do that with the love of my life.</p>
